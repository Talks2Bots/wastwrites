She pushed off before dawn, the water still carrying the night. Her calendar weighed on her shoulders — meetings, obligations, the sense of being pulled forward into a day already claimed. Then, above the river, she caught it: a crooked chalk-line unraveling across the sky, fresh and raw. Not cloud, not weather. A rocket contrail — jagged, looping, like the scrawl of a hurried hand.

She realized she’d just missed the launch. Strange that only human minds could inscribe such a mark, half-scribble, half-signature. What would the ancients have called it? A warning, a blessing, a god’s command?

She turned the kayak homeward. The contrail drifted behind her, dissolving. Her day, still unmarked, lay ahead.
