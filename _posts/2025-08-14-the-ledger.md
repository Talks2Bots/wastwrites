{% newthought 'The universe keeps a ledger.' %} Tonight Mia would try to commit a small fraud. After the accident she wanted one thing the laws of the universe didn’t seem to allow: an edit. She needed proof that the world could forget. She started with a marble.

## Experiments

Josh kept a jar of pennies on the bedroom bureau. Beneath it, the sock and underwear drawers had stayed shut since she came home carrying a white bag of pills. Socks and underwear, the ordinary proof of him, now on the wrong timeline.

As she approached the jar, she noticed that the copper smelled faintly like blood. On top of the pennies sat a glass marble with bright red swirls. An olive-colored espresso cup waited upside down on its matching saucer in the kitchen. Mia slid the marble under the cup. The act felt petty and ceremonial at once. It was a surreptitious test.

She went to bed, stretched out, still feeling multiple aches from the accident, some in her body, others in spirit.

2:11 a.m., she woke to the refrigerator humming. With effort, she pulled herself from bed and went into the kitchen. She lifted the cup. The marble was exactly where she’d left it, red-veined and dumb. Of course it was. The ledger balanced its line without a smudge.

She washed the cup and put the marble back on top of the pennies. Sleep came in hard, thin strips.

By morning Mia had a plan. If the world insisted on remembering, she would dare it to forget in view of a witness. She filmed the placement of the marble this time, humming so there would be sound. She went to bed with the cup in her mind like a set trap.

## Unhinged

When Mia woke near three, she padded to the kitchen, flipped the switch, and lifted the cup. Empty porcelain. Her phone showed no new video. No thumbnail, no file, no trace. Illuminating the bedroom, the marble gleamed atop Josh’s penny jar.

Mia sat, feeling the floor sway as if she were on water, and counted her breaths until the room steadied. Had the universe heard her telepathic plea? Or had she dreamed putting the marble under the cup? Her dreams had been so vivid lately; her mind so undependable.

The next day, Mia set a more deliberate test. She wrote on a sticky note, dated and timed it, and taped it to the fridge: Placed marble under cup at 10:41 p.m. She wrapped strips of masking tape across the penny jar’s opening. She dusted a thin circle of flour around the cup to show if it moved. She set her phone to record and switched it to airplane mode.

When she woke near three, the flour ring was perfect. But the saucer beneath the cup was empty. The marble sat in Josh's jar. The tape over the lid was unbroken. Her phone showed no new recording. The sticky note on the fridge had her handwriting and her time, yet something about the slant of the letters looked borrowed. She stood there until the hum of the refrigerator sounded like a tone held too long.

## Elsewhere

She needed the hallway to be ordinary. She opened her door, saw the hall she knew, walked to the stairwell, and went down.

Outside was not her street. The awnings wore unfamiliar logos. The air smelled like wet stone and lilies. A bus hissed past in colors she didn't recognize. Josh was there on the sidewalk, alive and moving quickly, already lifting his hand as if he knew her. Her chest lifted and stalled. She raised a hand, then stopped. The ground felt slanted, like the world had rotated by a few degrees.

Josh smiled, but his eyes slipped past. He walked to the next doorway and folded into someone else’s arms.

## Letting It Hold

She stood until the bus pulled away and the lilies thinned in the air. Then she went back upstairs.

Inside, her apartment had the same furniture in the same places. She stared at the marble and felt the ache seize her limbs, a sharp pain that slowly released its grasp.

She removed the tape from the top of Josh’s penny jar. The marble was there. The world held. She let it.
