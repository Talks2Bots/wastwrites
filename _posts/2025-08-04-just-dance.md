{% newthought 'The summons climbed in pitch.' %} 

'We need to go,' Emily said. "Five minutes."
Nick sat at the little white table, top hat beside the orange drink, head in his hands. Tails, white bow tie, a carnation tired at the edges.

"You go without me," he said.

She smoothed the coral skirt, set a hand on his shoulder. "We can’t disappoint the crowd."

A buzzer sounded, flat then rising. The room was white on white: two chairs, a plastic table, a sleeping niche, a rinse stall, a bare practice room.

"Have some juice," she said.

"No." He jerked upright. "I want my life back."

He dropped to his knees and sobbed. The juice warmed Emily’s chest without asking permission. The buzzer climbed.

"Together," she said. "We promised."

He wiped his eyes. "All right. Let’s go."

## The Bowl

Music thumped. They stepped into the glass bowl. Tentacles unfurled on the other side, suckers puckering in rings. Nick bowed. Emily curtsied. The crowd swayed in the water.

She called them octopods. Naming helped. The way their suckers kissed the glass looked like hands she had seen pressed to ICU windows.

They danced. Ballroom, the old movies. Before whatever took them, neither of them had known a foxtrot. The vids taught them. Better steps brought more space, softer beds, food that tried to remember Earth. It had felt like a trade. Maybe a good one.

## The Trade

Shows started once a day, then six. They ate on schedule, slept on schedule, danced on schedule. It was not so different from before, when calendars told them what came next and called it freedom.

The toddlers were here today, big-eyed and eager, like Sunday visitors with programs and balloons. Emily leaned into Nick’s step. He was a sack of flour. She learned to lead without showing it.

Back home, he had been the rock through their son’s messes and her cancer. Here, more than a year into what she called Octoplanet, she had never felt better. The juice went warm behind her eyes the way good medicine does when it remembers what to quiet.

## The Plan

After the last show they changed into pressed scrubs cut like the gowns she remembered tying behind her neck. Emily slid open the meal slot, set a tray in front of him, kept her voice light.

"They won’t even talk to us," he said. "We’re animals in a zoo."

"I’m starving," she said, and ate.

He shoved his tray toward her. "How can you put up with it? And stop drinking that. It’s addictive. They’re manipulating us."

He was a pharmacist. If he did not know the compounds, he did not drink them. He had, at first. Then he stopped.

"You said we’d stick together," he pressed. "We should strike. No shows. No food."

"What do we demand?"

"Home."

She could not see how refusal got them there. It felt more likely the hosts would replace them.

"I don’t know, Nick," she said, and knew she should have kept quiet.

He threw the juice. Orange ran down the wall and puddled on the floor.

"Okay," she said. "We’ll try your plan." She pushed her glass out of reach.

That night she dreamed the lake. The cottage was grander, the rowboat trimmed in teak, the water clear enough to see her hands pulling through it. Eagles turned above her.

## No Show

Morning. They let breakfast sit. The summons sounded, then rose in pitch, angry even, the way hospital machines climb when they want a body to behave.

Nick fidgeted. "Are we doing the right thing?"

"We’ll see," Emily said.

She pictured the bowl, the crowd waiting on an empty stage. Then the lights died.

Darkness was complete. Sound thinned to a wire. Emily tested her breath and found it steady. Beside her, Nick’s turned short and high, like the minute before anesthesia takes hold. His grip on her arm went slick.

"I can’t breathe," he said. "They’re pulling the air."

She could breathe. He could not, or believed he could not.

"Okay. We’ll dance," he shouted into the dark. "Give us back the air. Turn on the lights. Please."

The lights snapped on. He went straight to the slot, pulled a glass, and drank it in one shot.

After that they never missed. Nick hit his marks and smiled like a puppet. Emily opened herself to the music. The crowd beyond the glass swayed and waved. The more he thinned, the more she burned. Each day she felt younger. At night he cried. She dreamed she could swim the whole lake, then lift from the shore and ride a clean wind beside the eagles.

## Alone

One morning he was gone. On the glass where his head had often rested, a faint ring of pale ovals marked the surface, as if something had tested it with a patient hand of suckers. On the table, his cup sat empty beside a folded blanket, hospital neat.

When the tone sounded, Emily improvised a solo. She was not nervous. The octopods swayed, tentacles bright with approval.

She drank the juice, ate the food, danced, and dreamed. Sometimes she tried to make sense of what any of it meant and where Nick had gone. Sense did not come. Energy did.

## Back

She woke with no idea where she was. She took a breath and blinked until the room settled. Nick’s face came into view, smiling.

"Emily, sweetie. You’re back," he said, and kissed her cheek.

Blue curtains to the left. A shell lamp straight ahead. Pill bottles to the right. Her wrist itched where a plastic bracelet had once rubbed, though she could not see a mark.

So they had sent her home after all, she thought, or she had finally arrived. Either way, the day would ask for something, and she would decide whether to dance.
