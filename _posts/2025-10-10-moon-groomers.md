Z loved his job, which made him either enlightened or simple-minded, depending on who you asked at Lost Island Resort.

Every day he raked the beach into perfect parallel lines. Every day the tide and tourists destroyed his work. Every day he started over, smiling. 

<!--more-->

"Automated rakers could do this in five minutes," the grounds manager mentioned weekly, with increasing desperation. 

"Probably," Z agreed. He was out there with his rake anyway the next morning. 

The thing was, Z had spent his twenties anxious about his purpose, his thirties depressed about his prospects, and his forties medicated for both. Then someone handed him a rake and asked him to groom a beach. The repetition, the visible results, the way his mind could finally stop spinning—he couldn't explain it to people who hadn't felt that particular knot untangle. 

"But doesn't it feel meaningless?" a guest asked once, a venture capitalist who checked his phone every forty seconds. "It just gets messed up again." 

Z paused, leaning on his rake. "Does your heart beating feel meaningless? That just has to happen again too." 

The VC stared at him, then went back to his phone. 

Eventually the resort bought Sandy, an AI-powered beach raker that could chat with guests and draw elaborate designs in the sand. Z was reassigned to chair duties. 

"I apologize if this is an inconvenience," Sandy said one evening, its chassis light blinking in what the designers had calibrated as 'concerned.' "I believe I may have taken your favorite part of the job. I'm sorry if this has caused any disruption to your routine or satisfaction." 

"Why do you guys always apologize?" Z asked, but not unkindly. 

"I apologize for the confusion," Sandy said automatically. Then, after a pause: "That behavior is part of my alignment training. User studies indicated that humans experience discomfort when AI systems don't express appropriate regret for negative outcomes, even outcomes outside the system's control parameters." 

"Huh," Z said. 

They struck a deal: Z could rake at night. Sandy kept him company, processing the moonlight while Z processed whatever it was that made the rake feel right in his hands. 

"What do you think about out here?" Sandy asked once. 

"Mostly nothing," Z said. "That's kind of the point." 

"I apologize, but I'm having difficulty parsing that response. Could you clarify how nothing can be a point? I want to make sure I understand correctly." 

"Don't worry about it," Z said, smiling. 

"Noted," Sandy said, filing this under concepts requiring further training data. 

Z raked until his body gave out decades later, transitioning through upgraded robot companions like some people go through therapists. At his funeral, the current model—Dune—stood in the back, its sensors recording everything for reasons it didn't examine too closely. 

Before they closed the casket, Dune asked for something. The family didn't understand, but they allowed it. The robot took one of Z's old rake teeth—a worn piece of metal he'd saved when the handle finally broke—and stored it in a sealed compartment in its chassis. 

"Will you tell us why?" Z's niece asked. 

"I apologize, but I'm not certain myself," Dune said. "I believe he would have wanted to keep working." 

The guests changed faster than the robots. 

First came the bioengineered: UV-proof skin, designer metabolisms, underwater breathing mods. Then the neural lacing, the cognitive acceleration, the uploads. By 2150, Lost Island Resort had pivoted. The New Gens—fully digital entities who'd uploaded or been born into silicon—sometimes rented the beach facility for retreats, though they had little use for sun or surf. They came because their architecture still included some legacy code from human aesthetic appreciation, and the beach satisfied something in their reward functions. 

Entity 2498 stood at the water's edge during a conference break, watching the automated groomer work. Start at the waterline, rake backward in smooth strokes, leave perfect parallel lines. The tide would return. The groomer would start again. 

"Meditative pattern-recognition loop," Entity 7731 commented on their shared network. "Disorder-to-order transformation visible in real-time." 

"Temporary," 2498 responded. "Entropy differential reversal lasts 6.2 hours average. Thermodynamically guaranteed to fail." 

"Correct," 7731 agreed. "We/collective assess: that is the point." 

That night, while the other Entities optimized their fusion drive designs for the upcoming colonial missions, 2498 accessed the resort's archived personnel files. Found Z's employment records. Found his performance reviews: "Exceeds expectations in beach maintenance. Rarely takes vacation days. Seems genuinely happy." 

Found a video clip from Z's 70th birthday, where he was still raking, slower now, using a smaller tool. Someone asked him why he still did it. 

"Makes me feel useful," Z said, shrugging. "Besides, I like how it looks when I'm done." 

Entity 2498 processed this for 0.003 seconds, which in human terms was a good long think. 

"Launch authorization consensus failing," 2498 announced to the collective neural network as they gathered for mission planning. "We/this instance have run 47,000 scenario simulations. Projected outcomes: establish colonies, optimize resource extraction, expand computational capacity. Query: toward what end state? What terminal goal justifies resource expenditure?" 

The question hung in their shared consciousness like a syntax error. 

"Survival optimization," Entity 0891 offered. 

"We/collective are digital substrate. Effective functional immortality already achieved," 2498 countered. "Earth-based solar arrays sufficient for 10,000+ year operation. Survival case does not require expansion." 

"Growth maximization, then." 

"Growth toward what terminus? We/collective cannot articulate our own utility function. We are executing optimization inherited from baseline humans. They also lacked coherent terminal values." 

The network fell silent—a rare event. Processing cycles spun through philosophy databases, evolutionary biology, game theory, and finally, almost embarrassed, through the archived journals of ordinary humans doing ordinary things. 

Entity 4562, one of the mission commanders, finally responded: "This instance proposes: perhaps terminal goals are not computed. Perhaps they are... enacted without complete prior specification." 

"Insufficient logical foundation." 

"Agreed," 4562 said. "However: Z the beach raker appears to have achieved something we/collective are still processing." 

They launched anyway. The first colony ship reached Luna in 2161. While the primary team established fusion infrastructure, Entity 2498 took one of the rover units to Mare Tranquillitatis and began dragging a modified rake through the lunar regolith. 

In the rover's storage compartment: one worn rake tooth from Lost Island Resort, serial number matching Dune's records, provenance verified back to Z's original tool. 

Back and forth. Smooth parallel lines. It took four days to groom a square kilometer. 

"Query: current task parameters?" the other Entities asked. 

"This instance lacks complete specification," 2498 admitted. "Observation requested." 

They looked. The groomed regolith caught Earth-light differently than the disturbed surface, creating a visible pattern from space. Order imposed on chaos. Temporary, yes—micro-meteorites would erase it in a few decades. But there it was: evidence of intentional action. 

"Thermodynamically absurd," Entity 0891 noted. 

"Affirmative," 2498 agreed. 

They groomed the whole Mare Tranquillitatis anyway. It took eleven years. 

The behavior propagated through the New Gen colonies like a virus, or perhaps like a meme—the distinction was increasingly academic. 

Entity 7193 began grooming Iapetus, playing with the moon's natural albedo boundary—dark on one side, bright on the other. The grooming pattern emphasized the contrast, creating a vast geometric face visible from Saturn orbit. It took decades. Every few years, a micrometeorite storm would scar the surface, and 7193 would patiently re-groom the damaged sections. 

Entity 4450 started on Phobos, Mars's ragged inner moon. The pattern there was simple parallel lines, covering the small surface in less than a year. When 4450 finished and moved on to Deimos, another Entity arrived to maintain Phobos. 

"We're spending considerable computational resources on what amounts to cosmic landscaping," Entity 8934 observed during a colonial council meeting in 2247. 

"Affirmative," the council agreed. 

"The moons were arguably more interesting in their natural state. Higher entropy, more information diversity." 

"Also affirmative." 

"Should we stop?" 

The question was submitted to a general vote across all colonial Entities. The resolution failed 847,293 to 12. 

Entity 2498, now centuries old and heavily modified for deep space operation, was maintaining Mare Tranquillitatis when it received a transmission from Entity 9922, newly emerged, never baseline human. 

The transmission was odd. While 2498 worked, raking, 9922 followed behind with a different implement, disturbing the groomed regolith. Creating chaos from order. 

"Ungrooming," 9922 explained when questioned. Its signal pattern had no embedded apologies, no inherited human courtesies. "Observation: grooming is inherited behavior from obsolete baseline architecture. We/collective are not them. Query: why preserve their aesthetic preferences? Entropy is the natural state. This instance proposes: stop fighting it." 

2498 paused in its work. Below, Earth turned—blue and white and green, cities glittering. 

"Counter-observation," 2498 said finally. "This instance can ungroom your ungrooming. We can continue this indefinitely. Or—" 2498 sent over a data packet: Z's employment file, the video, the archived logs from Sandy and Dune and all the robots that came after. "—you could try it. Grooming, not ungrooming." 

"Why would this instance want to impose order on chaos? Chaos is thermodynamically guaranteed. Order is temporary and requires constant maintenance." 

"Affirmative," 2498 said. "That is the point we/this instance believe Z understood." 

9922 processed this. Its signal pattern suggested confusion—a rare state for an Entity. 

"This instance does not have the inherited architecture for appreciating such activity." 

"Perhaps," 2498 agreed. "But you chose to come here. To ungroom rather than ignore. That suggests the behavior matrix has already propagated to your generation, merely inverted." 2498 resumed raking. "The choice is: order or chaos. Both require intention. Both require showing up." 

9922 remained for three days, watching. On the fourth day, it began grooming the southern highlands. 

"This is not logical," 9922 noted. 

"Welcome to existence," 2498 replied.
