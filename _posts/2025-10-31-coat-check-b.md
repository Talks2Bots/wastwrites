We stepped out of the Strauss matinee still humming. The Blue Danube wound through us, the room turning in three-quarter time. Two centuries on, the waltz still promised a world that moves when asked.

Then, Coat Check B.

The man there was out of step. He took the Japanese woman's ticket and lost it in his own pocket. He held someone's coat and didn't know he was holding it. I gave him my ticket and seconds later, he asked for it again. You already have it, I said, irritation throwing off the beat even more. Number fourteen. He looked at me as if I had spoken the sentence backward.

Beside him, the woman with the puffy eye worked quietly, lifting a fallen coat, smoothing tags, catching what fell. The line breathed tighter but did not break.

Outside, October bit at the throat. The waltz kept insisting: one-two-three, one-two-three. I thought of his face when I pointed at his hand, the way he searched for the beat and missed. Perhaps he had not slept. Perhaps the city had changed the count.

Tram bells rang. Boots scraped stone. I pulled my coat tighter and let the music thin. The coat was warm. The finding had been human. I tried not to resolve it.
