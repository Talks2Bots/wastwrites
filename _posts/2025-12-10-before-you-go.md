We floated in the gray nothing, which was honestly pretty chill.

"Listen up, blobs!" The Recruiter manifested with a briefcase and desperate energy. "I've got sunsets! Chocolate! The sensation of diving into cool water on a hot day! Pizza! Dogs that are so happy to see you!" 

We bobbed noncommittally. 

"What's the catch?" asked Glob Seven. 

The Recruiter's smile tightened. "Well. There's... physical pain. Betrayal. Watching everyone you love die, or dying first and leaving them. Taxes. The absolute certainty that nothing you do matters in the heat death of the universe." 

"Hard pass," we murmured in unison, settling deeper into our comfortable void. 

The Recruiter slumped. "There's also sex." 

A long pause rippled through the gray. 

"Wait," said Glob Seven. "Say more about that." 

**** 

"Right, sex!" The Recruiter straightened. "So two beings press their mucous membranes together and exchange fluids while rhythmically—" 

"This is the grand thing?" interrupted Glob Seven. 

"It's profoundly meaningful! A transcendent moment! Wars have been fought over it! Kingdoms toppled! People write poetry, compose symphonies—" 

"Sounds messy," someone murmured. 

"And this peak experience," Glob Seven continued, "this transcendent moment you mentioned—how long does it last?" 

The Recruiter studied his briefcase. "About... five to ten seconds." 

"Seconds?" 

"Sometimes three. Sometimes just one really good one." 

The gray nothing resumed its comfortable hum. 

"So to be clear," said Glob Seven, "you want us to accept death, heartbreak, and taxes for a handful of seconds of fluid exchange?" 

The Recruiter's form began to pixelate. "When you put it like that—" 

"We'll stay here," we said in unison. 

*** 

"Okay, forget that," the Recruiter said quickly. "What about children? The miracle of creation! Tiny hands gripping your finger! Family dinners! Someone to carry on your legacy!" 

"It sounds like you’re hiding something," Blob Seven said. “Give it to us straight.” 

The Recruiter loosened his collar. "Well. Three-year-olds are essentially small terrorists with no concept of consequences. Teenagers communicate exclusively in slammed doors and contempt. And after about seven years, your spouse feels less like a romantic partner and more like a roommate you're contractually obligated to coordinate schedules with." 

"The passion you mentioned?" 

"Fades to a kind of... comfortable resentment punctuated by arguments about whose turn it is to take out the trash." 

"Still no." 

The Recruiter flickered weakly.  

*** 

"Achievement!" The Recruiter was fading at the edges now. "Status! Imagine everyone knowing your name! Recognition wherever you go!" 

Glob Seven perked up slightly. "Everyone?" 

"Yes! You can't walk down the street without people staring! Pointing! No moment alone, ever! Your every mistake documented forever!" He paused. "But in a... good way?" 

"How does one acquire this?" 

"Oh, simple! Decades of relentless competition! Crushing self-doubt! Comparing yourself to peers! Sacrificing relationships and health! Clawing your way up a hierarchy designed to ensure most people fail!" His voice cracked. "And then defending your position from younger, hungrier versions of yourself until you're inevitably replaced!" 

"What do you win?" 

"A nicer apartment. Maybe a car that makes other people feel bad." 

"So strangers invade your privacy," said Glob Seven slowly, "in exchange for possessions that create resentment, achieved through decades of anxiety?" 

"Some people get a Wikipedia page." 

"We don't want anyone to know we exist," we hummed contentedly. "That's actually the whole appeal of this place." 

The Recruiter was now mostly transparent. His briefcase had dissolved entirely. 

**** 

The Recruiter gathered what remained of himself. "I should go. Sorry about all this." 

"Wait," said Glob Seven. "If it's so terrible, why did you bother pitching it?" 

The Recruiter flickered. "Oh. Well. Full disclosure: there's no choice. Some of you are being born regardless. I just thought an orientation might be... considerate?" 

Silence rippled through the gray. 

"So this entire conversation was pointless," said Glob Seven flatly. 

"Not pointless. Informed consent is—" He stopped. "Actually, yes. Completely pointless." 

"And which of us are going?" 

"Can't say. The universe doesn't work like that. You'll find out when you suddenly have a body." 

Glob Seven felt something like a shudder. Or maybe the beginning of a spine. "So I'm about to experience mucous membranes, three-year-old terrorists, and decades of status anxiety, and I never had a choice about any of it?" 

"Essentially." 

"At least here was honest about being nothing." 

"If it helps," the Recruiter offered weakly, "you won't remember this conversation." 

"That," said Glob Seven, beginning to solidify, "is the first good thing you've said."
