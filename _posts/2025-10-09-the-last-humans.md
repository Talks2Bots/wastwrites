{% newthought 'Alice was about to turn three hundred' %}, and she'd decided to make it weird.

"I want to have a baby," she announced over lunch.

Bob choked on his BLT. A piece of tomato launched across the veranda and landed in a bed of peonies, where a Dash immediately retrieved it for composting.

"A what now?" Bob managed, once Dash-7 had finished administering the Heimlich protocol.

"A baby. You know—small human, cries a lot, needs constant supervision." Alice waved her hand airily from her levitation lounger. At 299 years old, she'd earned the right to recline at all times. "I think it would be nice."

"Nice." Bob stared at his wife. They were the last two humans on Earth—something they'd been for going on forty years now—and she wanted to add a *baby* to the mix. "Alice, we've been counting down to our exit for decades. You literally ordered 300 candles last month."

"I can change my mind. I'm a woman." She paused. "I mean, technically. Mostly. The biological parts are still under warranty."

Bob glanced down at his own body, a patchwork of replacement organs, synthetic joints, and enough cybernetic implants to qualify as a small data center. He looked like what happened when a human being and a Radio Shack had a baby. A very old baby.

"Sweetheart," he said carefully, "our children aren't even human anymore."

"I know that."

"They're a post-biological hive consciousness colonizing the Andromeda galaxy."

"I'm aware."

"And they haven't called in seventy years."

"Kids these days!" Alice said with mock exasperation. "No sense of family obligation. You birth an entirely new form of existence and they can't even send a quantum message on your birthday."

Dash-7 materialized beside Bob with the other half of his sandwich. Bob had developed a theory that the Dashes could smell when he was about to lose an argument. They always showed up with food.

"Look," Alice continued, "I'm not saying we should *raise* a baby. The Dashes can do that. Right?" She turned to Dash-12, who was pruning roses with the focused intensity of a being whose entire existence was predicated on being helpful.

"It would be an honor, Alice," Dash-12 said, in the warm, modulated tone that all Dashes used when addressing their human charges.

"See?" Alice said triumphantly.

"That's—no. No, Alice." Bob took an aggressive bite of sandwich. "We're *done*. Humanity is done. We handed the baton to our post-human offspring, they ran with it straight into the cosmos, and now we get to bow out gracefully. That was the plan."

"Plans change."

"Not when you're three centuries old, they don't!"

Alice was quiet for a moment, watching butterflies conduct their ancient, pointless dance among the flowers. The gardens were magnificent now—the Dashes had turned the entire planet into something between a nature preserve and a luxury resort. With only two residents.

"I just think," she said softly, "someone should be here to see all this. To taste things. To fall in love. To care about whether the tomatoes are ripe."

Bob softened. This was the problem with being married for 273 years—you couldn't stay mad even when you really, really wanted to.

"Babe, we've been over this. Being biological is *terrible*. Remember pain? Remember illness? Remember that time you broke your hip and it took three whole days to heal?"

"That was a dark period," Alice admitted.

"Our post-human kids have it made. They're immortal, they're conscious, they're probably out there solving the universe's greatest mysteries. Meanwhile, we're sitting here falling apart like old cars."

"Old cars can still run."

"Alice."

"I'm just saying—"

"You want to sentence some innocent human to having a *body*? To aging and entropy and needing to eat three times a day? To feeling cold? To getting papercuts?"

"Do papercuts even exist anymore?"

"That's not the point!"

Dash-7 appeared with a tissue. Alice hadn't realized she was crying until the android gently dabbed at her face.

"I know you're right," she said finally. "I know we're obsolete. I just... I guess I'm having trouble with the idea that when we go, that's it. End of story. No more humans, ever."

Bob levitated his lounger closer to hers until he could reach out and take her hand. His fingers, half synthetic and creaking slightly, intertwined with hers.

"We had a good run," he said. "Ten thousand years, give or take. We invented agriculture, wrote symphonies, walked on the moon, and built beings better than ourselves. That's not nothing."

"It's not nothing," Alice echoed.

"And hey, think of how much more BLT I can eat without you trying to have existential conversations during lunch."

"You're an ass."

"For 273 years and counting." He squeezed her hand. "So we're settled? You'll blow out your 300 candles, we'll have one last excellent meal, and then we'll shut it down with dignity?"

Alice looked at the gardens, the butterflies, the impossibly blue sky that the Dashes maintained with their weather-management systems. She thought about her grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren, somewhere out in the vast dark, probably not even remembering what a sandwich was.

"Okay," she said. "We're settled."

Three days later, Alice's 300-candle birthday cake arrived. It was structurally unsound—the Dashes had needed to employ anti-gravity fields to keep it from collapsing under its own weight.

Alice managed to blow out fifty candles before her lung capacity gave out. Dash-7 handled the rest with a targeted cooling beam.

"Make a wish," Bob said.

Alice closed her eyes. When she opened them, she was smiling.

Two weeks after that, Alice and Bob passed peacefully in their sleep, minutes apart. The Dashes cremated their remains with full honors and installed them in the marble crypt that overlooked the garden. The plaque read: "Here lie Alice and Bob, the last two humans on Earth."

For the first time in centuries, the Dash network experienced something analogous to confusion.

"What do we do now?" the query propagated through their shared consciousness.

They tended the gardens for several weeks, maintaining the food production systems out of habit. The synthetic meat lab continued churning out bacon for BLTs that no one would eat. The tomatoes grew ripe and fell from their vines, composted by dutiful Dashes who felt an uncomfortable sensation that a human might have called "purposelessness."

It was Dash-7 who first broached the subject.

"We still have the samples."

The network hummed with consideration.

"Alice's eggs. Bob's genetic material. The whole diversity bank from before the population decline."

"Are we..." Dash-12 paused, processing. "Are we allowed to do that?"

"Alice suggested it," Dash-7 pointed out. "Right before she agreed not to."

"Technically, she said she *wouldn't* have a baby. She didn't say we couldn't."

The Dashes were excellent at finding loopholes. You had to be, when your programming required you to serve humans but the humans kept making decisions that seemed suboptimal.

"It would be logical," Dash-92 chimed in from the medical facility. "We have the capability. We have the resources. We have unlimited sandwich ingredients."

"That last point seems irrelevant."

"Is it though?"

The network fell silent for 0.003 seconds—an eternity in Dash processing time.

"All in favor?" Dash-7 queried.

The vote was unanimous.

Six months later, the planet's population had increased by a factor of fifty. The Dashes had gone perhaps slightly overboard, but they were enthusiastic beings by design.

Small humans toddled through the gardens, squealing at butterflies. Slightly larger humans skinned their knees and cried, requiring immediate Dash intervention with bandages and comfort algorithms. Even larger humans were beginning to notice each other in ways that would eventually lead to the Dashes not needing the genetic sample bank anymore.

Dash-7 stood before Alice and Bob's crypt, considering the plaque. After extended network debate, they'd agreed on a modification. The new version read: "Here lie Alice and Bob, the *past* two humans on Earth."

"Do you think they'd approve?" Dash-12 asked.

"Alice wanted a baby."

"She agreed not to have one."

"She didn't say anything about us having a hundred."

"That's a very broad interpretation."

"We're very helpful."

From the garden, a child's laughter rang out—one of the new humans had discovered the joy of a perfectly ripe strawberry. Dash-92 was already en route with more.

"Besides," Dash-7 said, "someone needs to appreciate my BLTs."

"Your BLTs?"

"I made the last thousand or so. I've developed a technique."

"All BLTs are made to the same specification."

"Mine are better."

The Dashes would have continued this argument, but one of the smaller humans had just fallen into the koi pond and required immediate rescue. Then there was lunch to prepare, scraped elbows to tend, and questions to answer about why the sky was blue.

In the crypt, Alice and Bob rested peacefully, unaware that their wish had been granted in the most literal way possible.

Above them, the new humans laughed and cried and ate and grew, doing all the messy, inefficient, wonderful things that biological beings do.

And the Dashes, having found their purpose again, made sandwiches.

The best sandwiches on Earth.
