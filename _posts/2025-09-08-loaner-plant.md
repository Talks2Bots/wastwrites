The pothos was already a little long—green ropes slack with winter light—when Maya left for Zurich and handed me the pot. "Just water when the top is dry," she said, the kind of instruction that sounds simple until you have to trust it. By the window, the city made its usual gray noises; I could see my breath on the cold pane the first morning I checked the soil.

I watered. It perked. A week later I nudged the curtain to give the vines more blue sky. I texted her a photo and she hearted it with a thanks and a plane emoji and a time I couldn't convert in my head. I watered again, not much. The stems felt like confidence.

Then came the afternoon I thought about how dry airplane air is and whether that dryness reaches across oceans into apartments, and I poured a little more. The leaves went green and glossy in a way that felt like praise. I liked being good at this. I liked that I could be good at this.

Two days later, one leaf yellowed at the amber rim, then another. I pinched them off and patted the soil as if apology had weight. The pot felt heavy—white ceramic holding water like a kept secret. I set it farther from the glass. I looked up "overwatering pothos" and found myself negotiating with strangers' paragraphs at 1 a.m.

When Maya called, the clock in my kitchen said one hour, her window said violet dusk. We talked about her mother's tests. About the doctor's voice. About how sometimes a person can be both brave and tired and nobody claps. I did not mention the plant. I moved it onto a stack of cookbooks to feel more deliberate.

By the time the plane landed, a vine had blackened at the node, a tiny black bruise spreading along a vein. I cut it back with kitchen scissors and wiped the blades with a paper towel as if that changed anything. When Maya buzzed up, I opened the door and for a second couldn't tell if the look on her face was for the pot or for me. I said, "It's okay. I learned a lot."
