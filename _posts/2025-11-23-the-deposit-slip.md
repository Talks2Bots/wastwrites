Johann folded the napkin carefully and placed it on the table next to his empty breakfast plate. Louisa, his wife, rested her hand tenderly on his shoulder as she picked up the plate and carried it to the sink.

"Papa! Papa!" the not-yet-two-year-old Johann junior cried out from his high chair across the table. 

Johann couldn't help but smile with delight. Such a fine little fellow. Calling out to his papa. 

"What is it now, Bub?" Johann said, raising his voice to chat with his toddler son. 

"He knows you're about to head off to work," Louisa said, standing over the dishes in the sink. The early morning light glistened in her hair, and for a moment Johann wanted to say something about it—about how the light made everything in the kitchen seem golden and perfect, about how watching her there made his chest feel tight with a happiness he couldn't name. But he didn't know how to say such things. Instead he stood and kissed the top of her head. 

"I'll be back for lunch," he said. 

It was a lovely late-summer day as he strode off toward his workplace. Johann felt happy to be among the industrious people of this charming Swiss alpine town. He tipped his hat to a gentleman leading an older lady by the arm—visitors, he supposed, likely here to see one of the patients at the town's famous clinic. Next he passed the baker's shop and said good day to his neighbor, Mr. Schmidt, a widower buying his breakfast rolls. Then he passed the cobbler's shop and tipped his hat to a pair of workers fixing the road. 

Then Johann was at the post office. Being just twenty-three, he had held the job as assistant postmaster for a little over a year. But he felt immense satisfaction each time he took the large metal key from his pocket and unlocked the door. Today was a good day—no one waiting at the locked door. Johann didn't enjoy being rushed. He liked going in and having time to arrange his workspace. He always put everything away carefully before leaving in the evening. 

This morning he opened the drawer with the commemorative stamps and positioned the ink pad just so. He took out the mail bag and sorted through it, arranging letters by district, then by street, his hands moving with practiced efficiency. There was something deeply satisfying about bringing order to chaos, about these small rituals that made the world comprehensible. 

Now he was ready for the first customers. His colleague Gustav arrived, cheerful and already talking. The morning went well—good traffic but not too hectic. Gustav chattered on about his daughter's upcoming wedding, about the weather, about the new pharmacist in town. Johann nodded and made appropriate sounds while he worked, stamping and sorting, stamping and sorting. 

At eleven, a man entered the post office. Johann had seen him before. An elderly man, perhaps a gentleman once, though his gray suit, clean and proper, was very old and worn. He had a long haggard face, flat cheekbones, and the hands of a workman. He didn't approach the counter. Instead, he took a deposit slip from the customer table and stood by the window. Using the pen and ink provided, he began to write. He had a rapt, concentrated expression. He smiled to himself. 

"That must be the famous author," Gustav remarked eventually in a lowered voice. 

Johann was taken aback. How could such a down-at-heel old man be a famous author? 

"Who is he?" he asked. 

"Don't know his name. Supposedly one of the most famous Swiss writers. But that was a long time ago. He's at the asylum now." 

Johann watched the old man scribbling intently on the deposit slip. What could he be writing? Louisa loved words and poetry especially. She had a flair for life like that. Sometimes she would read to him in the evenings from the newspaper or from a book borrowed from the neighbor, and her voice would change, become something musical, and Johann would feel that tightness in his chest again—that sense of something beautiful just beyond his understanding, something he wished he could give her but didn't know how to find. 

He returned to his work, stamping letters with steady rhythmic thumps. When he looked up again, he was surprised to see it was almost the lunch hour. The old man was still standing at the table by the window, though he had stopped writing. He suddenly raised his head and looked straight at Johann. He had the brightest blue eyes Johann had ever seen—clear and alive and utterly present. Then he gave a sort of smile, folded the deposit slip, and let it drop into the waste basket under the table. Then he walked out the door. 

Johann's curiosity got the better of him. After Gustav had gone to lunch and he was locking up for the hour, he retrieved the waste basket and found the folded deposit slip. When he opened it, he saw it was covered, front and back, with minuscule handwriting—so tiny he had to squint to see it was even letters. He couldn't read a word. The old man had spent an hour creating this, and simply thrown it away. 

Johann stood there holding the paper, feeling something he couldn't name. It seemed wasteful. It seemed mad. But those bright blue eyes had been so alive. 

On his walk back to the Herisau Asylum, Robert Walser's steps were light and buoyant. He felt the September air on his face, noticed the way the light fell through the trees onto the road. His mind was still humming with the story he had just written. 

It had been a good one. He knew that with the same certainty he knew his own name. There had been a woman in it, and a child, and autumn coming on. There had been a moment of grace that he'd managed to catch in words—or rather, the words themselves had become the grace, had created something that hadn't existed before. For that hour at the post office window, he had been entirely alive, entirely present, entirely free. 

He understood his situation clearly. He understood he wasn't necessarily in his right mind, understood his limitations, understood why he was where he was. But he also understood writing, and he knew with absolute certainty that what he had just made was beautiful. 

That was enough. More than enough. 

There had been a time when he'd needed the world to see his work, to acknowledge it, to tell him it mattered. That need had been like hunger, like thirst. But now he was free of it. The story existed—had existed perfectly for that hour of its making. Whether anyone ever read it was beside the point. The miracle was in the making itself, in the way attention and language could transform the nothing into something, could take the ordinary world and find it shot through with light. 

He thought of the young postal clerk who had been watching him. A good young man with kind eyes. Probably had a family. Probably lived a decent, ordered life. Walser wished him well. He wished everyone well. He felt enormously tender toward the whole world today, in this moment, walking back to the asylum where he lived, having just created something beautiful and thrown it away. 

He began to whistle. 

That evening Johann came home from work. He greeted his neighbors as he walked. He tipped his hat to passing strangers. He stopped at the flower shop and bought his wife a fresh bouquet—white roses and late-summer asters. There was no special occasion. 

"What lovely flowers!" Louisa beamed with delight when she opened the door to greet him. "Johann, what's this for?" 

"Look at the pretty flowers, Bub!" she called to their son. 

"Papa! Papa!" the boy yelled. 

Johann handed her the bouquet and looked at her standing there in the doorway, the flowers in her arms, their son calling out behind her, the evening light making everything golden again. He wanted to tell her something—about the old man at the post office, about the bright blue eyes, about the way someone could make something beautiful and then let it go. He wanted to tell her that he loved her in a way that made ordinary things feel like miracles. But he didn't have the words. 

"They're just flowers," he said finally, smiling. "I saw them and thought of you." 

Louisa kissed his cheek and brought the flowers inside to put them in water. Johann followed her in and closed the door behind them. Tomorrow he would go back to the post office and stamp letters and sort mail and arrange things in their proper order. And that would be enough. Or perhaps it wouldn't be, quite. But tonight there were flowers, and his wife's smile, and his son calling out "Papa!" and that would have to be enough for now.
