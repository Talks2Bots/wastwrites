The leaves of the pothos were vibrant and supple when Maya left for Zurich, pausing by the watering can. “Just water when the top is dry,” she said, the kind of instruction that sounds simple until you have to trust it. She rolled her suitcase through the door, gave a small wave, and was gone. The plant was an offshoot from one that had stretched across her grandmother’s sunroom window, glossy even in the shade.  Later, by the window, the city made its usual gray noises. I could see my breath cloud against the cold pane the first morning I checked the soil.

I watered. It perked. A week later I nudged the curtain to give the vines more blue sky. I texted Maya a photo, unsure when it would reach her. She was adrift in a time I couldn’t convert in my head. The watering can felt like a tether that kept her near. She hearted my text. I watered again, not much.

Then came the afternoon when Maya was off to the her next city. I thought about how dry airplane air is and whether that dryness reaches across oceans into apartments, and I poured a little more. The leaves went green and glossy in a way that felt like praise. I liked that I could be good at this.

Two days later, one leaf yellowed at the amber rim, then another. I pinched them off and patted the soil as if apology had weight. The white ceramic felt heavy, holding water like a kept secret. I set it farther from the watering can. I looked up “overwatering pothos” and found myself negotiating with strangers’ paragraphs at 1 a.m.

When Maya called, the clock in my kitchen said one hour, while her window held a violet dusk. She recapped her latest talk, how the room leaned in, how the questions kept coming. Her voice had the bright lift of something finally opening. I didn’t mention the plant. I set it on a stack of cookbooks, as if height could make my care look deliberate.

By the time her plane landed, a node had blackened, the black bruise threading along the leaf. I cut it back, wiped the scissors clean, pretending to undo what had already happened. The letter offering me a job in another city lay open on the table. My bags were still unstarted. When Maya buzzed up, I opened the door, and for a second I couldn’t tell if the look on her face was for the dying pothos or for me. “It’s okay,” I said. “I learned a lot.”
