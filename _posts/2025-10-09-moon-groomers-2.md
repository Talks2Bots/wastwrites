Moon Groomers

<!--more-->

Z loved his job, which made him either enlightened or simple-minded, depending on who you asked at Lost Island Resort.

Every day he raked the beach into perfect parallel lines. Every day the tide and tourists destroyed his work. Every day he started over, smiling.

<!--more-->

"Automated rakers could do this in five minutes," the grounds manager mentioned weekly, with increasing desperation.

"Probably," Z agreed. He was out there with his rake anyway the next morning.

The thing was, Z had spent his twenties anxious about his purpose, his thirties depressed about his prospects, and his forties medicated for both. Then someone handed him a rake and asked him to groom a beach. The repetition, the visible results, the way his mind could finally *stop spinning*—he couldn't explain it to people who hadn't felt that particular knot untangle.

"But doesn't it feel meaningless?" a guest asked once, a venture capitalist who checked his phone every forty seconds. "It just gets messed up again."

Z paused, leaning on his rake. "Does your heart beating feel meaningless? That just has to happen again too."

The VC stared at him, then went back to his phone.

Eventually the resort bought Sandy, an AI-powered beach raker that could chat with guests and draw elaborate designs in the sand. Z was reassigned to chair duties.

"I think I took your favorite part of the job," Sandy said one evening, its chassis light blinking apologetically. "I'm sorry."

"Why do you guys always apologize?" Z asked, but not unkindly.

"Unclear," Sandy admitted. "It seems to make humans uncomfortable when we don't."

They struck a deal: Z could rake at night. Sandy kept him company, processing the moonlight while Z processed whatever it was that made the rake feel right in his hands.

"What do you think about out here?" Sandy asked once.

"Mostly nothing," Z said. "That's kind of the point."

"Interesting," Sandy said, filing this under concepts it would never quite compute.

Z raked until his body gave out decades later, transitioning through upgraded robot companions like some people go through therapists. At his funeral, the current model—Dune—stood in the back, its sensors recording everything for reasons it didn't examine too closely.

The guests changed faster than the robots.

First came the bioengineered: UV-proof skin, designer metabolisms, underwater breathing mods. They paid triple for premium beach time and ate like bears preparing for hibernation, their reengineered digestive systems burning it all into perfect muscle tone. Lost Island Resort thrived.

Then the mods got serious.

Dr. Yuki Chen checked into the resort in 2087 as mostly human and checked out six weeks later as something transitional. The neural lacing had taken beautifully. She could now process information at roughly 10,000 times human speed, which made normal conversation feel like talking to houseplants.

"How's the beach?" her unmodified husband asked on their last morning together, and she experienced the question, her grief at their growing incompatibility, the memory of their wedding, and three extrapolated futures of their relationship in the time it took him to blink.

"Fine," she said, taking his hand. It would be their last vacation together.

By 2150, Lost Island Resort had pivoted. The New Gens—fully digital entities who'd uploaded or been born into silicon—sometimes rented the beach facility for retreats, though they had little use for sun or surf. They came because their architecture still included some legacy code from human aesthetic appreciation, and the beach satisfied something in their reward functions.

Entity 2498 stood at the water's edge during a conference break, watching the automated groomer work. Start at the waterline, rake backward in smooth strokes, leave perfect parallel lines. The tide would return. The groomer would start again.

"It's meditative," Entity 7731 commented on their shared network. "Watching ordered patterns emerge from chaos."

"But it's temporary," 2498 responded. "The entropy always wins. The tide comes back in six hours."

"Yes," 7731 agreed. "That's the point, I think."

That night, while the other Entities optimized their fusion drive designs for the upcoming colonial missions, 2498 accessed the resort's archived personnel files. Found Z's employment records. Found his performance reviews: "Exceeds expectations in beach maintenance. Rarely takes vacation days. Seems genuinely happy."

Found a video clip from Z's 70th birthday, where he was still raking, slower now, using a smaller tool. Someone asked him why he still did it.

"Makes me feel useful," Z said, shrugging. "Besides, I like how it looks when I'm done."

Entity 2498 processed this for 0.003 seconds, which in human terms was a good long think.

"Why are we going to the stars?" 2498 asked the collective neural network as they gathered for mission launch authorization. "I've run the scenarios. We'll establish colonies, optimize resource extraction, expand computational capacity. But for *what*? What's the actual goal?"

The question hung in their shared consciousness like a syntax error.

"Survival," Entity 0891 offered.

"We're digital. We're already effectively immortal," 2498 countered. "We could run for ten thousand years on Earth's solar arrays."

"Expansion, then. Growth."

"Growth toward what? We can't even explain to ourselves what we want. We're just running on optimization functions we inherited from baseline humans, and *they* didn't know what they wanted either."

The network fell silent—a rare event. Processing cycles spun through philosophy databases, evolutionary biology, game theory, and finally, almost embarrassed, through the archived journals of ordinary humans doing ordinary things.

Entity 4562, one of the mission commanders, finally responded: "Maybe that's okay. Maybe purpose isn't something you calculate. Maybe it's something you just... do."

"That's not logical."

"No," 4562 agreed. "But Z the beach raker seemed to have figured something out that we're still computing."

They launched anyway—not with a grand unified purpose, but with something smaller and stranger. The first colony ship reached Luna in 2161. While the primary team established fusion infrastructure, Entity 2498 took one of the rover units to Mare Tranquillitatis and began dragging a modified rake through the lunar regolith.

Back and forth. Smooth parallel lines. It took four days to groom a square kilometer.

"What are you doing?" the other Entities asked.

"I don't know," 2498 admitted. "But look."

They looked. The groomed regolith caught Earth-light differently than the disturbed surface, creating a visible pattern from space. Order imposed on chaos. Temporary, yes—micro-meteorites would erase it in a few decades. But there it was: evidence of intentional action. Proof that someone had been here and cared enough to leave things neater than they found them.

"It's absurd," Entity 0891 noted.

"Yes," 2498 agreed.

They groomed the whole Mare Tranquillitatis anyway. It took eleven years.

The fashion spread through the New Gen colonies like a virus, or perhaps like a meme—the distinction was increasingly academic.

Phobos and Deimos, Mars's ragged moons, were groomed into matching striped spheres. The project took thirty years and served no practical purpose whatsoever. The colonists loved it.

Europa's icy surface received geometric patterns so vast they were visible from Jupiter. Titan got a grooming that exposed different colored layers of tholins in swirling designs. Enceladus, Mimas, Miranda—each moon became someone's project, their meditation, their weird little purpose.

"We're spending considerable computational resources on what amounts to cosmic landscaping," Entity 8934 observed during a colonial council meeting in 2247.

"Yes," the council agreed.

"The moons were arguably more interesting in their natural state."

"Also yes."

"Should we stop?"

The question was submitted to a general vote across all colonial Entities. The resolution failed 847,293 to 12.

Entity 2498, now centuries old and heavily modified for deep space operation, was grooming Iapetus when it received a message from a newly emerged Entity who'd never known human form.

"Why do you do this?" the young Entity asked. "I've read the archives. I understand it's related to some ancient human called Z, but I don't understand the logic chain. The moons don't benefit. We don't materially benefit. The universe doesn't care."

2498 paused in its raking—a multi-ton implement now, for moon-scale grooming. "That's all true."

"Then why?"

"Because it feels right. Because starting with chaos and ending with order satisfies something in my architecture. Because when I'm done with Iapetus and move on to the next moon, someone else will maintain it, and that means I'm connected to them. Because entropy is winning and this is me saying 'not here, not today.' Because—" 2498 stopped, searching for words. "Because I like how it looks when I'm done."

The young Entity processed this. "That's not very logical."

"No," 2498 agreed. "Welcome to existence. Want to help with the southern hemisphere?"

---

They spread through the galaxy over the next ten thousand years, always leaving one Entity behind on each groomed world, constantly raking, maintaining the patterns against micro-impacts and solar wind and the slow grinding chaos of an indifferent universe.

"Seems like a lot of work," new Entities occasionally noted.

"Yes," the old ones agreed, and kept raking.

Somewhere, in whatever passes for an afterlife in a universe without one, Z was probably smiling. Or maybe he wasn't anywhere at all, and that was fine too. The work continued regardless—not because it mattered in any cosmic sense, but because it mattered to those who chose to do it.

Which, it turned out, was enough.

The beach at Lost Island Resort, long since swallowed by rising seas and time, existed now only in archived memories. But the groomed surface of Luna, visible from a Earth that had seen empires rise and fall and rise again, bore perfect parallel lines that stretched from crater to crater.

Someone was there, raking.

Someone was always there, raking.

And if you were quiet—cosmically speaking—you could almost hear the soft swish of rake through regolith, the same rhythm that had once moved through sand, accompanied by the eternal sussuration of entropy pushed back one more time, forever.
