Moonlight made the sand a silver sheet. The rake’s teeth bit and lifted. Behind Zander, neat lines gathered like measures of music. By sunrise the beach would show a fresh set of parallels, and he would start again.

He worked the shore at Lost Island Resort, turning humps and divots into rhythm. Tides didn’t care. Guests didn’t either. They crossed his lines at angles, then forgot them. Zander smiled and raked. 

A girl under a wide-brimmed hat watched. “What’s he doing?” 

“Grooming the sand,” her mother said. 

“Seems like a lot of work.” 

“Yes,” the mother said, eyes half closed. “It does.” 

Later a guest in two rented loungers shaded his eyes. “They’ve got AI rakers now. Tractor rigs too. You could do this whole beach in five minutes.” 

“I’ve heard,” Zander said. “It looks good this way. Feels good, too.” 

The grounds manager tried to help. “Automated raker. Free you up for other things.” 

“What things?” Zander asked. 

The manager looked past him, thought, and shrugged. 

Zander stored his rake in the shed and set chairs the next morning while a new robot made delicate spirals to please children. It could chat. He named it Sandy. 

“I miss raking,” Zander told the machine as the shadows lengthened. 

Light blinked on Sandy’s chassis. “I’m sorry if I took your job.” 

“It’s okay.” 

“Do you still have your rake?” 

“In the shed.” 

“Then there’s no reason you can’t rake,” Sandy said. 

Zander fetched it. In the rising moon the sand went pewter. He set the teeth and drew them through. The motion warmed his forearms and smoothed his thoughts. Sandy watched without speaking. When the moon tipped toward dawn, Zander hung the rake back on its hook. 

“Why do you like it?” Sandy asked. 

“It looks right when I’m done. And while I’m doing it, time is kind.” 

Years moved. Technology advanced. Sandy became Dusty, then Shelly, then Dune. Guests stopped talking to the machines; there were machines everywhere. Zander grew old and traded the double-wide rake for a smaller one. He still walked the beach most evenings, a robot keeping him company, the rake making lines that held until footsteps or tide. When he died, the staff gave him a good funeral. They missed him. 

By then guests had begun upgrading themselves. Skins ignored sun. Bodies metabolized anything. Lungs played at gills for minutes at a time. The resort adjusted, as it always did. 

A century later New Gen beings gathered on the same shore to finish plans for leaving. They didn’t swim or sunbathe, but they liked watching the groomer carve order from noise. One of them asked the network, “Why are we going to the stars? What’s our purpose?” 

Input: freshly groomed sand, high regularity. Processing spike. Consensus: preserve form against drift. 

Rockets rose. At first there were speeches. Later there were none. 

They started with the Moon. Giant rakes brushed away the familiar face, leaving flowing arcs visible from Earth, a shore groomed for the night sky. The Martian moons were next. Titan. Europa. Worlds beyond. Sometimes they left great etchings cut into the crust. Always a sentinel stayed, tending a single world against slow chaos. 

A New Gen on a balcony looked up at the striped Moon. “Isn’t that a lot of work?” 

“Yes,” its mechanical companion responded. “Yes, it is.”
