Just Dance

{% newthought '“We need to go,” Emily said, keeping her tone measured.' %} “The day’s final show is on in five minutes and the crowd's waiting,” Emily stood over Logan, looking fetching in her simmering gown that hugged her slender waist and opened into a full skirt the color of pink coral. She was well into her fifties, but her figure was trim and her attitude perky.

Logan, of a similar post-midlife vintage, was seated at the little dining table in their sparse accommodations, his top hat resting next to a full glass of orange liquid, his head in his hands. He was dressed in a tuxedo with tails, a white bowtie, and had a fluffy white carnation pinned to his left lapel.

The room was glaringly white, furnished with two plastic chairs (though their actual material was unknown), a plastic dining table, something resembling an outdated TV, and a sleeping nook with a mattress just big enough for two. In one corner was a bathroom with toilet and provisional rinsing station. An adjacent room was completely bare and used for practice.

“You go without me,” Logan mumbled, without lifting his head.

“Honey, come on,” Emily said, injecting more urgency into her tone as she bent down closer to her husband. She put a hand on his shoulder reassuringly. “I know you’re not feeling up to it today, but we can’t disappoint the crowd.”

Emily also vaguely worried about the consequences of their not sticking to the schedule

“Are you sure you don’t want a sip of the jolly juice?” she offered, reaching for one of the two glasses on the table.

“No!” Logan nearly screamed, jumping up from his chair. “I can’t take it anymore, Emily! I want my life back!”

He sank to his knees and started sobbing. Emily looked down at him, concerned but not completely sympathetic. The jolly juice had a way of hardening you to other people’s emotions. She picked up her glass from the table and took another swallow. There was a was a loud, annoying buzz calling them to the stage.

"Logan, we’re in this thing together, we promised each other,” she said. “Let’s just get through this, and then tonight we’ll talk.”

Logan stood up and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. Emily was relieved to see that he was pulling himself together.

“All right, let’s go,” he said.

## The Performance

As they approached the stage, they could hear the pulsating music. The audience was swaying in time to the rhythm of the music. Logan and Emily stepped onto the stage, holding hands. Logan bowed, Emily curtsied, and the crowd went wild, their tentacles curling and unfurling with excitement as they floated around the viewing arena. Some of their suckers stuck to the outside of the reverse fishbowl which contained the stage on which Logan and Emily performed.

The couple began to dance, their fluid movements mesmerizing the crowd. They danced to the music, full-on ballroom style, like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Maybe the octopods had somehow seen the movies? For whatever reason, they were enthralled by the real thing. Ironically, before they were sucked up by the UFO, Logan and Emily didn’t even know how to dance, but once on the octopod planet, inside their reverse fishbowl, they gradually understood that ballroom dancing was what was desired, or required, of them.

They had studied every day from videos they were provided. The better they got at dancing, the more their lives improved. They were moved from what was essentially a small containment pod to a furnished room. An effort was made to mimic human food. When they were sick, they received care. At some point, it had seemed like a good trade. After all, there wasn’t anything else for humans to do on octopod world, which seemed to be made completely of water, so they might as well learn to dance inside their little bowl.

## Their Situation

Then the performances started. At first, once a day. Now, six times a day. Otherwise, they ate, slept, and sometimes trained. For Emily, the crowd made it tolerable, if not enjoyable. Like today, there was a group of toddlers. Octopod children were almost cute, with their big eyes and cute little suckers, and they were so enthusiastic. “Look at that little guy… or gal,” Emily still couldn’t tell them apart, with its swaying blob of a head moving back and forth to the dance rhythm. She smiled and leaned into Logan’s step, even though she could feel her husband’s heart wasn’t in it today. In fact, it felt like she was dancing with a sack of flour. But she was growing used to his diminished performance capabilities and had learned to take the lead without it being too obvious.

She had to admit; their situation was dismal. They had no idea why they’d been taken or what would happen to them. Odds were they’d never see their son again or find out if he and his current girlfriend would get engaged, or if she and Nick would ever have grandchildren. Grandchildren were something she’d looked forward to, but the truth was, their son didn’t seem to be all that anxious to start a family. So, who knew?

Then there were the repetitive performances. Truly it was a nightmare. But still, Emily was a little surprised how quickly Nick had crumbled. Back at home, he’d always been the rock, standing firm to weather any storm. He’d always been unfazed by their son’s many teenage and young adult indiscretions and lapses, helping to shepherd him into a marginally respectable adulthood. Whereas Emily had been overwhelmed and often at her wits end.

And Nick had been unshaken when Emily got the cancer diagnosis, while she herself had been a chocolate mess. He’d encouraged her and helped throughout her treatments. Speaking of the treatments, they’d been on Octoplanet (their name for it, since they didn’t know their host’s language) for over a year and Emily had never felt better.

Now, in front of the final crowd of the day, she was able to take the lead in their foxtrot without the audience noticing. Her enthusiasm deflected from Nick’s half-hearted performance, and she channeled the energy of the crowd to pump up her steps and twirls. She smiled and could sense that she sparkled, the thousands of tentacles waving with appreciation.

## The Confrontation

Later that evening, after they’d rinsed and changed into freshly pressed scrubs, Emily slid open the door to the small compartment over the dining table where their meals were delivered. As usual, there were two plastic trays, each with a sizable, covered plate and a cup of juice. She reached in, pulled out one of the trays, and set it gently in front of Nick, trying to exude cheerfulness and nonchalance. She knew he was on edge.

“Goddamn bastards won’t even talk to us,” he muttered, ignoring his wife’s effervescence. “We’re just animals in their goddamn zoo. They shove us food through a slit like we’re gorillas or something.”

Emily took a deep breath. She thought about how to respond in a way that would show her support and not rile Nick up further. But she was also wary to voice any direct criticism of their hosts. Even though the octopods chose not to communicate with them in any direct way, they obviously understood English. Emily even sensed that the hosts could read their minds.

“I’m starving,” was all she said, and moving the remaining tray to her place on the table, she sat down and picked up a fork. As she ate, she could feel the weight of Nick’s gaze.

“I don’t know how you can put up with it,” he said finally. “Here.” He shoved his tray towards her across the table. “I’m not hungry. Enjoy.”

He stood up and made as if to go somewhere. But then he sat back down again and seemed to try to calm himself.

“You shouldn’t be drinking that juice,” he told her firmly, motioning with his chin towards the orange liquid. “It’s obviously addictive. And who knows what sort of a number it’s doing on your brain, and your whole system. Emily, they’re manipulating us. Don’t you get it?”

Emily understood Nick’s aversion to the mysterious jolly juice concoction. Afterall, he was a pharmacist and had been one for over 30 years. If he didn’t know the chemical compounds of something with obvious medicinal characteristics, he wasn’t going to take a chance with it. True, he’d drank the juice for a while after their arrival. But once he realized its various mood-altering properties, he’d sworn off the stuff.

“Seriously, honey,” he reiterated, pointing to the half-full glass next to Emily’s plate.

Emily wasn’t sure how best to respond. Nick’s refusal to imbibe of the juice reminded her of her terminally ill grandmother. At the beginning of what had turned out to be the last week of her life, Nana had refused morphine because “it was addictive.” Once the pain became unbearable, though, she finally relented. So what if the jolly juice was altering her mood? Wasn’t that the point? How else would their situation be bearable?

“We have to drink something,” she said, going for what seemed like a plausible response.

Nick gave her a stern look. “You said earlier today that we agreed to stick together, right? I did today’s last performance, even though I didn’t want to. I didn’t abandon you. And you’d said we’d talk things over, right?”

Emily nodded in agreement.

“We need to stand up to these ... things,” Nick said.  “We need to rebel. They obviously want us to dance. Without us, they won’t draw in these crowds. From what I see, we have some leverage. We should strike. We should go on a hunger strike and a performance strike.”

Emily put down her fork. She could tell Nick was serious.

“What would be our demands?” she asked, interested in his plan.

“That they take us back home. Obviously. They brought us here, wherever here is. They can bring us back!”

Emily didn’t see the logic in Nick’s approach. Sure, maybe they could strike for a few days to demand fewer daily performances, or bigger accommodations, for example. But why would striking motivate the hosts to send them back home? If they stopped obliging, it seemed more likely the hosts would simply get rid of them and bring in a more complaint couple.

“I don’t know, Nick,” Emily heard herself say. But as soon as the words left her mouth, she knew she should have kept quiet.

Nick looked at her, then he stood up, grabbed the cup of jolly juice, and flung it against the wall. The orange liquid trickled down the white wall and dripped onto the hospital white floor.

“Ok, ok,” Emily said. “Let’s try your plan.” Maybe Nick was right. Emily felt so much had changed, not just with their circumstances, but with her grasp on reality and sense of self, that she might not be judging the situation correctly. She and Nick had always been different, but she’d rarely doubted his clear-headedness and moral compass. If anything, she’d often looked to her husband whenever she’d felt a nagging sense of nihilism, which, honestly, had nagged her many times during their terrestrial past.

“Maybe you’re right that we can take charge of our destiny.  It’s worth a shot.” To show that she meant what she said, Emily purposely pushed the glass of jolly juice out of reach.

That night Emily dreamt of the cottage on the lake where she and her family had spent idyllic summers before her parents had divorced. In the dream, the cottage was much grander and the rowboat nicer, with teak trim and oars of spruce. She rowed by herself across the translucent waters, bald eagles soaring overhead.

## The Strike

In the morning, Emily agreed with Logan that they would forego breakfast. The steaming egg-like substance and the glasses of juice sat untouched behind the sliding dispenser door. When the tone sounded, summoning them to appear for the first performance of the day, they were still lying in bed in their loose-fitting sleeping garb. The first summons was soon following by others, each higher in pitch and more urgent--angry even.

Logan became fidgety, as if losing his conviction. “Are you sure we’re doing the right thing?” he asked anxiously, raising his voice over the strange sounds that blared out, calling them to their duty.

Emily knew they weren’t, but she tried to be reassuring. “We’ll see,” she said, keeping her expression even.

Time passed. Emily imagined the octos, adults and children, crowded eagerly around the bowl, waiting in anticipation but seeing only an empty stage. Then, without warning, their room went dark. The darkness was so intense, Emily couldn’t tell whether her eyes were open or closed. Logan groaned.

“This is horrible!” he said after only a few minutes, gripping Emily’s arm so tightly that it hurt. “I can’t breathe!”

“It’s ok, honey,” she said, trying to calm him.

“They’re killing us! They’re sucking all the oxygen out of the room. Can’t you feel it?” His voice was shaking, the sweat from his grasp making her arm slick.

She could breathe just fine. She was about to say something when she heard him shout out.

“Ok, ok! We’ll dance! We’ll dance,” Nick yelled. “Just give us back the air! Turn on the lights! Please!”

He was frantic. The lights came back on. Logan got up quickly and went straight to the dining area. He opened the food slot, yanked out one of the glasses of jolly juice, and downed it in one shot.

From then on, they were careful never to miss a performance. Logan’s dancing became increasingly robotic. He went through all the motions, even smiled, but his body seemed to be teleoperated by someone who just didn’t care. Emily continued to try to pick up the slack, opening her soul to the music and letting it work its way through her body in fluid expression that thrilled the audience beyond the glass bowl.

The more Logan receded, the more vigorous and alive she became. Each day she felt younger. Rather than sapping her energy, the dance seemed to infuse her being with renewed vitality.

As Logan lay awake at night sobbing, Emily dreamed of endless summers on the lake. She could swim like never before, circumnavigating the entire body of water without tiring. Even more miraculous and thrilling, she could flap her arms and lift herself off the ground, catching the breeze to soar with the eagles.

## Alone

One morning when she woke up, Logan was gone. He had simply vanished. When it came time for the performance, Emily improvised a solo dance. She wasn’t nervous or self-conscious. She had never felt more self-assured. The octopods swayed their tentacles enthusiastically. Clearly, her solo performance was well received.

Emily continued to drink the juice, to enjoy her meals, to dance, and to dream. At times she tried to grasp what was happening, why she was here, what it all signified, where Logan had gone. But she resigned herself to the fact that there was no way to make sense of it all. She’d never felt better, or this alive, or so powerful.

## Back

Then she woke up and had no idea where she was. She took a deep breath and blinked, struggling to focus. Logan’s face came into view, a smile spreading across his mouth.

“Emily, sweetie! You’re back! You’ve come back!” He squeezed her shoulder, leaned in to kiss her cheek.

Her body oriented itself to the surroundings--the window with the blue curtains to the left, the bureau with the shell lamp straight ahead, the side table to the right, covered with her pill bottles.

So, they had sent her home after all, she thought, and wondered where life would go from here.
