{% newthought 'The empty corner should be filling her with a sense of triumph' %}, she knew. Did it? Strangely, no. Instead, there arose a sense of loss, a heaviness at the recognition that his presence had passed out of her life forever.

“You can use the corner here for you work area,” she’d offered, when they’d occupied the house nearly 30 years ago.

“This’ll be perfect,” he’d said, not so much gratefully as matter-of-factly. After all, he’d be spending way more time in the house than she would, given her frequent work travel at the time. It seemed only fitting that he should have the back room, with its magnificent view of the river, for his office space.

He’d assembled the L-shaped desk so it wrapped around the side wall and then along the very back, with its windows opening out onto the river vista. They’d both longed to live right on the water, and the housing market dip after 2009 offered the opportunity they needed.

It was their first time living together. She knew it was a gamble. Surely he thought so too. She’d observed his living habits in the form of unpacked cardboards boxes cluttering his rented condo to the point of impending maneuverability. But she could overlook the mess, because it came with the love and companionship she’d longed for.

Little by little, all these objects that comprised the space of his personality, the satellite objects of his life, had wandered into her orbit and made themselves at home in their house. Boxes of papers appeared, along with coils of various sized rope, pictures in frames that would never be hung, miscellaneous computer parts, oil lamps, trophies, cans of various spray, canvas satchels from decades-old work events, assorted flags, to name a few of the more identifiable pieces.

Over the years the mountain grew, and occasionally declined, but always remained a constant unsightly pile collecting dust, preventing any sort of responsible cleaning of the back window and blinds. It had become a truly mortifying heap of junk that embarrassed her to the core when the HVAC maintenance man had to pass through on the way to the condenser—not to even speak of the ignominy endured during visits by family and friends.

Renting a storage space at extortionist prices year-round had, mysteriously, not led to the anticipated decline of the pile, but only to the collection of new objects that quickly claimed the available space, like hermit crabs occupying discarded shells.

In those dreamy moments when she imagined her future, she envisioned a world where she outlived him, and as soon as he was gone—God rest his soul—she would phone up Two Hunks in a Trunk and have them cart off every last thing, chucking it unceremoniously into their vehicle and hauling it away, never to be seen again. It always seemed like a distant paradise—something she pined for weakly, softly anticipated, like a hazy utopia, but always slightly beyond grasp.

Now, on returning to the house after getting away for a while after the event, she stood in the empty back room, looking at where the heap used to spread out in all its chaotic and maddening glory. Finally, after all these years of waiting, she could set up her clean, cozy reading nook overlooking the river.

She sunk to the floor, reaching for something to cling to, but found nothing.
