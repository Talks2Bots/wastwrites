{% newthought 'The truck rumbled away' %} and the house exhaled. In the back room, the far corner of carpet was a patchwork of pale rectangles where boxes had squatted, darker lanes between them, once hidden stains, and tired dents from desk legs. Dust rose in celebratory spirals. Jenn stepped gingerly across the newly uncovered terrain, pausing as if to get her bearings in unfamiliar country. The river outside went calmly about its business, as if none of this were historic.

The Heap had finally been evicted. 


It had never called itself that, of course. The Heap didn't need a name to be territorial. It had crept in on soft feet, claimed the corner by the window, and—inch by strategic inch—migrated toward the river, as if it, too, wanted a view.<!--more-->

## T–48 Hours

{% newthought ' Jenn picked up her phone' %} and typed “junk removal” into the search bar, scanning the list for local companies with the highest ratings. It felt unreal to be here, at a moment she had imagined for decades but never fully believed she would experience. The future stretched ahead, full of unknowns. 

A knot of fear tightened in her chest. The Heap, for all its aggravation, had become a constant presence, a familiar shadow in the corner. In a way, it felt like a stubborn friend that never called but was always there. But, she thought, even friends overstay their welcome. It was time for the Heap to move on. 

## Origins

{% newthought 'It began innocently.' %} “You can use this corner for your work area,” Jenn had said nearly thirty years earlier, full of decency and the optimism of people who haven’t moved in together yet. 

“This’ll be perfect,” Max replied, matter-of-fact. He’d be home more than she would. Back then her suitcase lived in the hallway. It only seemed fair that he take the back room with the river view. 

They’d both dreamed of living on the water, and the post-2009 housing dip had cracked the door open. They’d shoved through together, giddy and a little terrified. 

Jenn had known it was a gamble. She’d seen Max’s rented condo, the cardboard boxes perched like bad-tempered boulders, the paths between them narrowing to a balance-beam. But the mess came with companionship and a way of being looked at that made her feel seen. You can make peace with a lot for that. 

## Stardust

{% newthought 'Little by little' %}, the satellite objects of Max’s life drifted into their orbit and stayed. Boxes of papers. Coils of rope—no two the same thickness. A commemorative shovel from a groundbreaking that never quite broke ground. Three flags of unknown nations. Two oil lamps. A trophy for Attendance. Six power supplies that fit no known device. A framed picture of a boat they never bought. Cans of several lubricating sprays. Canvas satchels from conferences whose logos had outlived the companies. One canvas bag labeled 2003—IMPORTANT (containing a kazoo). 

The Heap accepted all offerings and demanded more. 

“Look,” Max once said in the doorway, tying something with one of the ropes. “Bowline.” He tugged the knot; it refused to slip. “King of knots. Refuses to let go.” 

“Appropriate,” Jenn said, smiling despite herself, and tried to ignore that the colony of cables had multiplied again. 

## Laughter

{% newthought 'Renting a storage unit' %}at extortionate prices didn’t shrink the Heap for long. It simply cleared enough space for Max to start a fresh layer, the way an incoming tide smooths the sand before littering it again. 

There was also the matter of visitors. 

The HVAC tech headed for the back door, his eyes flicking toward the pile in the corner as he passed. Jenn’s reflex kicked in. “Sorry about the mess,” she said. 

He gave a small shrug without breaking stride. “I’ve seen worse.” 

She wasn’t sure if that was meant to comfort her or simply state a fact. Either way, it didn’t help much. 

Aunt Lila stood there another time, hand pressed to her sternum. “Is this—oh!—is this a visiting art installation?” 

“Umm,” Jenn hesitated. “It’s actually part of the permanent collection.” 

They laughed. There was nothing else to do for it but laugh. But Jenn always died a little, inventing detours for repairmen and pretending the mess didn’t bother her, even as it gnawed steadily at her soul. 

In her weaker moments, she imagined a future where she outlived Max (God rest his beloved, cluttered soul) and, the very next morning, she’d call Two Hunks in a Trunk to cart every last thing away. It was a hazy paradise she both dreaded and desired—the sort of confession you make to a priest or to an algorithm that promises not to judge. 

## T-24 Hours

The estimate guy walked through the back room with a clipboard, whistling low. 

“Nice view you have here,” he said, nodding toward the window.

“Thanks," Jenn acknowledged. "Most people can’t see past the foreground installation.” 

He nodded. "Don't worry, we'll have it cleared away for you in no time."

The estimator paused by the desk, tilting his head as he studied the bolts and brackets. “We’ll need to break this down to get it out,” he said.

Jenn remembered the day Max had carried the glass panels in, the metal frame laid out like a kit on the floor. He’d spent the afternoon assembling it, fitting the frame to the corner so the glass caught the river light. Now the surface was invisible under piles of papers, cords, and unidentifiable clutter, the weight of years pressing down on it.

The estimator scribbled something on his clipboard, and Jenn looked away from the corner.
The river glinted. 

## T-0 Hours

{% newthought 'The day came' %}with sun so bright the dust looked festive. The haulers lifted, grunted, and vanished. The truck door rolled down like a theater curtain. Jenn wrote the check with a hand that didn’t feel attached. The truck coughed, growled, and trundled away. 

Silence returned, a kind she hadn’t heard in years. 

She stepped into the vacated room. It was all suddenly small. The house, the years. 

She should scrub, she thought. She should set up a chair, a lamp, a place to read where the afternoon light curls up and naps. 

## Origins (Refrain) 

{% newthought 'They had wanted the water' %}. That had been the point. The view was their first shared sentence. On their first morning in the house, hair unkempt, coffee in mugs that didn’t match, Max had leaned on the sill and said, “We did it.” 

“We did,” she’d said, and meant everything by it. 

## Views

{% newthought 'There was nothing now.' %}Nothing but the indents in the carpet, the scuffed paint, the silence that made a shape around her. She thought about one of their first nights in the house together. 

“I can’t believe we got a place like this, with such an incredible view,” she’d said softly, as she sat next to Max in the backyard.  

He’d turned to gaze at her. “You’re right,” he’d said. “This,” and he’d made it clear he meant only her, “is the most incredible view in the world.” 

Now the room tilted. Her knees didn’t give from emptiness, she realized, but from the weight of it all. She sat on the flattened carpet that would soon be replaced with new hardwood, just as she’d always imagined. But she wasn’t thinking about the new floors. For once, she wasn’t thinking at all.

The dust settled.

It would be a long time before the house, and she, learned to breathe without him.
